## Import required packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Problem 1

## Create the dataframe

``` r
example_df = tibble(
  random_samples = rnorm(10),
  sample_gt_0 = random_samples > 0,
  chs = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  fct = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mid", "mid", "mid",  "mid", "high", "high","high"), levels = c("low", "mid", "high"))
)
```

## Take the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, random_samples))
```

    ## [1] -0.1117422

-   `mean()` works for the column `random_samples`, whose data type is
    numeric.

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, sample_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

-   `mean()` works for the column `sample_gt_0`, whose data type is
    logical.

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, chs))
```

    ## [1] NA

-   `mean()` doesn’t work for the column `chs`, whose data type is
    character.

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, fct))
```

    ## [1] NA

-   `mean()` doesn’t work for the column `fct`, whose data type is
    factor.

## Try to use as.numeric() to convert logical, character and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(example_df, sample_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(example_df, chs))
as.numeric(pull(example_df, fct))
```

-   For the logical variable `sample_gt_0`, the output is consist of 0
    and 1. This is because the logical variable was converted to 1 for
    `TRUE` and 0 for `FALSE`.

-   For the character variable `chs`, the output is 10 NA. This is
    because a `character` value couldn’t be converted to meaningful
    `numeric` value in R.

-   For the factor variable `fct`, the output is consist of 1, 2, and 3.
    This is because these factor values are ordinal and they were
    converted to numeric values according to their corresponding level
    (1 for `low`, 2 for `mid`, 3 for `high`).

-   This partially helps to explain that why we can use `mean()` on
    logical variables but not character variables. In `mean()`, `TRUE`
    is also regarded as 1 and `FALSE` is regarded as 0. And `mean()`
    also don’t know how to convert character variables. The factor
    variable, although is supported by `as.numeric()`, is not supported
    by `mean()`, because `mean()` only takes numeric/logical vectors and
    date, date-time and time interval objects.

# Problem 2

## Load the peguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Describe the dataset

-   This dataset contains 8 variables, which are: species, island,
    bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
    body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

    -   `species`: This variable is a factor variable. It contains 0
        missing value(s). It is not ordinal, and has 3 categories:
        Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, which have 146, 68, 119 records
        respectively.

    -   `island`: This variable is a factor variable. It contains 0
        missing value(s). It is not ordinal, and has 3 categories:
        Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen, which have 168, 124, 52 records
        respectively.

    -   `sex`: This variable is a factor variable. It contains 11
        missing value(s). It is not ordinal, and has 2 categories:
        female, male, which have 165, 168 records respectively.

    -   `bill_length_mm`: This variable is a numeric variable. It
        contains 2 missing value(s). For this variable, the mean is
        43.92, the standard deviation is 5.46. The 0th, 25th, 50th,
        75th, 100th percentile values are: 32.1, 39.23, 44.45, 48.5,
        59.6.

    -   `bill_depth_mm`: This variable is a numeric variable. It
        contains 2 missing value(s). For this variable, the mean is
        17.15, the standard deviation is 1.97. The 0th, 25th, 50th,
        75th, 100th percentile values are: 13.1, 15.6, 17.3, 18.7, 21.5.

    -   `flipper_length_mm`: This variable is a integer variable. It
        contains 2 missing value(s). For this variable, the mean is
        200.92, the standard deviation is 14.06. The 0th, 25th, 50th,
        75th, 100th percentile values are: 172, 190, 197, 213, 231.

    -   `body_mass_g`: This variable is a integer variable. It contains
        2 missing value(s). For this variable, the mean is 4201.75, the
        standard deviation is 801.95. The 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 100th
        percentile values are: 2700, 3550, 4050, 4750, 6300.

    -   `year`: This variable is a integer variable. It contains 0
        missing value(s). For this variable, the mean is 2008.03, the
        standard deviation is 0.82. The 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 100th
        percentile values are: 2007, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2009.

-   This dataset has 8 columns and 344 rows.

-   The mean flipper length in this dataset is 200.92
